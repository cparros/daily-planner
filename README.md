This is an assignment from UNC Coding Bootcamp in which we were tasked to creat a functioning daily planner. We are required to use at least one third party API out of a list given. I chose to work with day.js.
This is one assignment that has really challenged me to work with a date API and think about if it is better to render dynamically or load ui in HTML and then save and update in script. 
It was a bit of a challenge but definitely great practice!
